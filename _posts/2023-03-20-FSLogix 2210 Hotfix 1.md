### FSLogix 2210 Hotfix 1 (2.9.8440.42104) Release Notes

This hotfix release addresses known issues and bugs identified in previous versions. Below is a summary of the changes introduced in FSLogix version 2210 hotfix 1:

#### Summary

**Profile Logs Warning**: Profile logs may show errors related to emptying the user's Recycle Bin on the SystemDrive. These errors should be treated as warnings and can be ignored. Users typically do not have access to the system drive, and in some cases, the Recycle Bin may not exist when attempting to empty it. This issue will be addressed in future releases.

#### Changes

- **New Configuration Setting (RoamIdentity)**: A new configuration setting, `RoamIdentity`, has been added. This setting allows legacy roaming for credentials and tokens created by the Web Account Manager (WAM) system.

#### Fixes

- **Crash Issue**: Resolved an issue where `frxsvc.exe` would crash when processing AppXPackages.

- **OneDrive Handling**: Fixed issues in handling FileIds associated with OneDrive.

- **Cloud Cache**: Resolved issues with orphaned meta files on Cloud Cache SMB providers.

- **Rename Operation**: Fixed a problem where a pending rename operation would fail due to an invalid target filename.

- **Session Cleanup**: Resolved an issue where user sessions were cleaned up before a proper sign out.

- **ODFC Handling**: Fixed issues with how ODFC (Office 365 Container) handled multiple VHDLocations.

- **Settings Application**: Fixed an issue in how settings are applied for ObjectSpecific configurations.

- **ODFC Container Detach**: Resolved an issue where an ODFC container wouldn't correctly detach during sign out.

- **VHD Disk Compaction**: Fixed issues with VHD Disk Compaction, including failure to cancel correctly when using Cloud Cache, and failure when RoamSearch was enabled for ODFC.

- **Recycle Bin**: Resolved an issue where users would be stuck at a black screen due to attempting to empty the Recycle Bin prior to roaming.

#### Policy Update

- **New Policy for RoamIdentity Setting**: Added a policy for the new RoamIdentity setting to manage legacy roaming for credentials and tokens.
